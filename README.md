RobotC-Code
===========

This is where we store our RobotC code for our VEX Robotics Competition programs.
RobotC is a language/IDE aimed towards STEM education use that we use to program
our VEX Robot. In this repo, we have various files stemming from test code to
competition ready files. The latest competition use files are usually denoted by
the name of the competition and possibly a date to indicate the final use date.
